# CEST
Codes and materials for CEST MRI data analysis

The Matlab script(s) provided are primarily supplementary to a 2019 JMRI publication "Optimization and repeatability of multi-pool chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI of the prostate at 3.0T" DOI: 10.1002/jmri.26690

They may be useful to anyone interested in carrying out Lorentzian linefitting analysis of CEST MRI data.

Primary functions of the code enclosed:

1) Fitting of voxelwise or ROI-based z-spectra using up to 5 Lorentzian lineshapes for water/CEST/NOE pools and a single lineshape (Lorentzian, Gaussian, super-Lorentzian or a straight line) for the MT resonance.
2) Asymmetry calculations from the normalized data.
3) Production of CEST and other parameter maps.
4) Parameter histograms.

If these codes are useful to you and feed into your future work please acknowledge this by referencing the above paper in any resulting publications.

2019-02-14: Raw scripts have been uploaded. These will soon be tidied up (de-cluttering, de-duplication of sections of code written during development, additional commenting for ease of use etc).
